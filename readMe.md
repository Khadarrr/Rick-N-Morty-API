JavaScript API

Course assignment for javascript API call.

My choice of Api fell on the Rick and Morty one that I previously had worked on true the module courses

I used my own folder to make the site and not the Vite pages, because I had already started before we got the repo, and when I tried to add it to the vite project the CSS that was already incorporated in there made it difficult for me to have an good overview of my project.

The lesson task and work we already had done true the course helped me a lot to get a good start with the course assignment.

The most difficult part of this CA for me, was what I wanted to add to the filter function on the cards and how to code that. Went first with trying to use the ascending filter with names (a-z) and a filter on dead and alive, but in the end ended with going with the filter of genders + search bar. Was lot of work but was satisfied when it worked. Specially the function that made it work together the search bar and the gender checkbox.

For the CSS design I used the games project as a blueprint and true out the project gave it its own style with the colors from the show and the logo.

Aplication stack:
Prettier - code formatter
Eslint - Find and fix problems in JavaScript code.
